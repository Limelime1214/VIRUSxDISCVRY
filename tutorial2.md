## Tutorial Objectives:

```
You may want to read through Assignment 3 first, and then pick up here.

The goal of this tutorial is for you to *play with your virus*. In terms of data
science we simply want to explore the possible space of meaningful analyses
and get a sense of direction. It's meant to be informal so as not to impede the
exploratory process, but do not mistake the lighthearted tone with a lack of
scientific rigor. The point is to create a space for you to make your "happy
mistakes" in, so you avoid them on your final assignment.

That being said, the primary rule for this tutorial and your assignment is
                               
                               _have fun :)_
```

Set-up:

```
## Story preamble:

Around the world, everyone stops, it's happening again and this time it looks
to be much worse.

You hear the news and there's a new Pandemic agent rapidly spreading across the
world. The parallels to SARS-CoV-2 are uncanny, but this time you will not allow
yourself to sit on the side-lines. You feel deeply responsible as a scientist to
help mitigate the oncoming pandemic, and you put aside all your research and 
school work to explore and understand what this infectious agent is. Very early
raw sequencing data begins to emerge and you know your MGY441 skills can lead
you to a meaningful insight. It's worth the attempt.

## Question 1 : Data Exploration `(5 points)` ----------------------------------

**Q.** For every story, journalists ask

- `(2 point)` *What* kind of virus is it? 
                     hint 1: What are the requirements for the formal 
                     classification of a new viruses and virus families?
                     hint 2: How can you quickly compare your viruses sequence
                     to a collection of known viruses?
                     
**A.** TODO

- `(1 point)` *Who* generated this dataset and is there a publication associated
                    with the sample?
                    hint: What does the `SRR`/`ERR`/`DRR` accession code refer to?

**A.** TODO
                     
- `(1 point)` *Why* was this dataset generated? Science experiments are done 
                    (mostly) with purpose. Try to understand the motivation
                    behind the dataset and can the discovery of a virus in this
                    sample-context add something to the story?

**A.** TODO

- `(0.5 point)` *How* was the data generated? Technically, what kind of data is
                      it?

**A.** TODO

- `(0.5 point)` *When* was the dataset generated?

**A.** TODO

## Question 2 : Follow the lede `(5 points)` -----------------------------------

**Q.**: Based on your set of answers in Question 1. Listen to the music.

Give yourself and rank-order `5 meaningful questions` about your virus and 
answer them, or begin to answer them by **any means available** to you. 

"Meaningful" in this context means I am asking you to make a judgement call and
prioritize 5 questions from the space of infinite possible trivial questions.
The implicit goal is to help you build experience in prioritization. Include a
justification unless you are certain the question is highly meaningful.

hint: To get to the bottom of this virus, act like a detective and follow the
trail left by the virus. Ask questions which will help you piece together a 
whodunit story about the virus.

**A.**: TODO

## Question 3 : Data storytelling `(4 points)` ---------------------------------

**Q:**: Continue the `Story Preamble` in the style of a *niche genre*, chosen
from the list below. Write a 200-350 word short story about your assigned virus
which incorporates *5 facts* you have uncovered about the virus. 

In your story, **write the 5 factual components in bold like this** to distinguish
it from the fantastic elements.

Genre Choices
  - [ ]  Hard-boiled detective novel
  - [ ]  Zombie horror
  - [ ]  Dystopian futurism
  - [ ]  Indoamerican myth
  - [ ]  Renaissance fairytale/fable
  - [ ]  Lovecraftian horror
  - [ ]  1950s futurism
  - [ ]  Diary logs of a 17th century pirate
  - [ ]  Gonzo/acid fantasy
  - [ ]  Dr. Seuss

**A:**

```

**Q.** `(bonus)` Create a generative AI cover image for your story and include
your prompt text. The image _must_ incorporate an artistic style from a specific
period, material, artist, or genre of visual art. Add the `.png` (or `.jpg`,...)
to your submission repository named `00_cover_art.<format>`.

## Question 4: Reflect `(1 point)` ---------------------------------------------
**Q.** Did you have fun? (The only wrong answer is not giving an answer)

**A.** TODO
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [ ] Maybe, why?
