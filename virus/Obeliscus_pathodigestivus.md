Crossing the Line: The Obelisk Discovered at the Intersection of Human Gut Metatranscriptomics and Bacterial mRNA

*Obeliscus pathodigestivus*

The genus name "Obeliscus" is latin for "Obelisk", while the species name "pathodigestivus" combines "patho-" (indicating disease) and "digestivus" (relating to digestion), suggesting the organism is involved in the digestive system and could cause digestive-related illnesses. The nomenclature also interprets potential association between this obelisk and infectious intestinal disease (or acute gastroenteritis).

## Abstract

In recent years, there has been considerable interest in voriod-like RNAs, which exhibit extensive ecological distribution and remarkable genetic diversity. Obelisks are a class of newly discovered viroid-like RNA elements with a single-stranded circular RNA genome whose ecological roles and evolutionary origins remain enigmatic. The remarkable diversity of obelisk species, observed in a range of ecosystems, suggests that much more investigation is needed to unravel the different roles they may play in microbial communities. Additionally, deciphering their structural and functional properties could reveal novel pathways influencing microbial metabolism and ecosystem stability. A specific cluster of novel Obelisk, Obeliscus pathodigestivus (Obelisk_001756_000001_000001), which has a circular RNA genome of 1490 nucleotides long, was detected in a sample of human gut shotgun metatranscriptomics collected in UK by the University of Liverpool in year 2023. In this study, we found that O.pathodigestivus contains an Oblin-1 sequence of 849 nucleotides, with the domain-A of Oblin-1 located between nucleotide positions 701 and 755. Also, it is predicted that Oblin-1 of O.pathodigestivus possesses the function of nucleic acid binding, implying its potential genome replication mechanism. Moreover, this obelisk, found in various environmental samples, seems to flourish in nutrient-dense environments with high microbial activity, such as the gastrointestinal tracts of mammals. The discovery of O.pathodigestivus in diverse environments, particularly the human gut, highlights its potential role in shaping microbial communities and influencing host-microbe interactions. Additionally, its predicted structure and function suggests a possible involvement in genome replication or host gene modulation. The widespread distribution of obelisks across ecosystems emphasizes the need to explore their roles in nutrient cycling, gene transfer, and microbial adaptation. Understanding these viroid-like RNA elements could offer insights into microbial ecology and health, with implications for disease mechanisms and environmental stability. Future studies should focus on their evolutionary origins and functional properties to fully unravel their ecological significance.
